## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}

###Exercise 3.1

# 50% = 18-29 - 200
# 60% = 30-44 - 250
# 40% = 45-64 - 300
# 30% = 60 and up  - 250

(200*0.5 + 250 * 0.6 + 300 * 0.4 + 250 * 0.3) / (200+250+300+250)


# 0.445 supports higher taxes 




```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

###Exercise 3.3

x <- seq(-3, 8, by = 1)
y <- dnorm(x, mean = 3, sd = 1)

plot(x, y, type = "l")



```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#### Exercise 3.4
# Probability distributions: Using a bar plot in R, graph the Poisson distribution with parameter 3.5.
```{r}

p <- rpois(67889, lambda=3.5)

hist(p)

?rpois

```


#### Exercise 3.5
# Probability distributions: Using a bar plot in R, graph the binomial distribution with 𝑛 = 20 and 𝑝 = 0.3.

```{r}
  x <- seq(0, 10, by = 1)
  d <- dbinom(x, size=20, prob=0.3) 
  
  hist(d)
```


###Exercise 3.6
#3.6 Linear transformations: A test is graded from 0 to 50, with an average score of 35 and a standard deviation of 10. For comparison to other tests, it would be convenient to rescale to a mean of 100 and standard deviation of 15.
#(a) Labeling the original test scores as 𝑥 and the desired rescaled test score as 𝑦, come up with a linear transformation, that is, values of 𝑎 and 𝑏 so that the rescaled scores 𝑦 = 𝑎 + 𝑏𝑥 have a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15.
#(b) What is the range of possible values of this rescaled score 𝑦?
#(c) Plot the line showing 𝑦 vs. 𝑥.

```{r}
# a) 

t <- seq(0, 50, by = 1)
x <- rnorm(t, mean = 35, sd = 10)

y <- x*1.50+50
hist(y)


# y = ax+b, so a = 1.5 and b = 50

y <- (x-mean(x))+100
hist(y)


# b)
range(y)

# 78 og 144
# eller er det 65 og 115??

# c)
curve(50 + 1.5*x, from=78, to=144)
curve(1*x, from = 0, to = 50)



```

#### Exercise 4.1
4.1 Comparison of proportions: A randomized experiment is performed within a survey. 1000 people are contacted. Half the people contacted are promised a $5 incentive to participate, and half are not promised an incentive. The result is a 50% response rate among the treated group and 40% response rate among the control group. Give an estimate and standard error of the average treatment effect.


```{r}

#estimate
0.5*(500/1000)+0.4*(500/1000) #  0.45

# SD
sqrt((0.45*0.55)/1000) # 0.157



```


#### Exercise 4.2
4.2 Choosing sample size: You are designing a survey to estimate the gender gap: the difference in support for a candidate among men and women. Assuming the respondents are a simple random sample of the voting population, how many people do you need to poll so that the standard error is less than 5 percentage points?

```{r}
?rpois

  
sqrt((0.45*0.55)/n) = 0.05
(0.45*0.55)/n = 0.05^2
0.45*0.55 = 0.05^2*n
(0.45*0.55)/0.05^2 = n

# you need 99 people




```


#### standardizing and normalizing

```{r}


t <- seq(0, 50, by = 1)
x <- rnorm(t, mean = 35, sd = 10)

normalized <- x-mean(x)
standardized <- normalized*1/sd(normalized)
hist(standardized)
sd(standardized)
mean(standardized)

```

#### Exercise 4.3
4.3 Comparison of proportions: You want to gather data to determine which of two students is a better basketball shooter. One of them shoots with 30% accuracy and the other is a 40% shooter. Each student takes 20 shots and you then compare their shooting percentages. What is the probability that the better shooter makes more shots in this small experiment?
```{r}

# Expected
#good
0.4*20 #8

#bad
0.3*20 #6



0.4-0.3 # 0.1 with standard error...

#SE
#good
sqrt((0.4*0.6)/20) # 0.11

#bad
sqrt((0.3*0.7)/20) #0.1.02

# SE diff
sqrt(0.1095445^2 + 0.1024695^2) # 0.15

# so theres a 0.1 probability that the better shooter makes more shots with a standard error of 0.15 - so it's basically equal if you don't have more throws. 


 
```

#### Exercise 4.4 
4.4 Designing an experiment: You want to gather data to determine which of two students is a better basketball shooter. You plan to have each student take 𝑁 shots and then compare their shooting percentages. Roughly how large does 𝑁 have to be for you to have a good chance of distinguishing a 30% shooter from a 40% shooter?
```{r}

0.4-0.3 #0.1, so SE have to be less than 0.1 - we want 0.05

sqrt((0.4*0.6)/n) = 0.05
0.05^2 = (0.4*0.6)/n
0.05^2*n = (0.4*0.6)
(0.4*0.6)/0.5^2

# we need 96 throws

#SE
#good
sqrt((0.4*0.6)/96) # 0.05

#bad
sqrt((0.3*0.7)/96) # 0.04677072

# SE diff
sqrt(0.05^2 + 0.04677072^2) # 0.068


```
4.5 Sampling distribution: Download a data file on a topic of interest to you. Read the file into R and order the data by one of the variables.
(a) Use the sample function in R to draw a simple random sample of size 20 from this population. What is the average value of the variable of interest in your sample? 
(b) Repeat this exercise several times to get a sense of the sampling distribution of the sample mean for this example.

```{r}

```
